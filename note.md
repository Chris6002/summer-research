# Finished
1. __model__
    - model-free method
    - hard to learn transition probability
2. __state__
    - feature vector
3. __policy__
    - encoder + lstm = $\pi(a,s_t,s_{t-1},s_{t-2},s_{t-3})$

# Next
## Idea
1. improve after BC(gail)

2. sample in real world( refer to bekerley training)
3. change to model-based?
## To do
1. LSTM imitaiton learning paper --  architecture

2. berkely social + hongkong city -- people model

3. berkely rc car -- how to train in real time
